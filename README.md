Learning all about in C and data structures. 
A3 consists of creating a binary tree. 
In A4, there were 3 objectives: 
1) Cities: Parsing city data and utilizing the C library's qsort implementation to sort cities by population.
2) Filter: Creating a program that processes image convolutions by applying a given kernel matrix onto a .ppm image files. This creates a filter or blur effect on the image (eg. Gaussian Blur, Unsharp masking) depending on the kernel. 
3) Fib: Developing a program that creates fibonacci fractals and displays the fractal as a bmp image.
